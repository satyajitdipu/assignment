  <h3><i><u><b>History of Daspalla</b></u></i></h3>
  <p>Available records, writings, books reveal that at first there was no such place known as Daspalla. Rather it was a part of Boudh State ruled by Bhanj Kings. During the rule of Bira Bhanj there was a rift in between Bira Bhanj and his cousin, Sal
    Bhanj. The dissident Sal Banj left Boudh and proceeded to meet the Gajapati of Puri through the ages old Jagannath Sadak. While resting with his followers at Padmlatola Forest, the king of Nayagarh got the news and made alliance with Sal Bhanj
    and declared him the king of that area. Getting the news, Bir Bhanj of Boudh got angry and sent a troop to capture Sal Bhanj. But the troop of Boudh got defeated at the hands of Sal Bhanj and Nayagarh soldiers. As Sal Bhanj got Yasha (Fame), he
    named his kingdom as Yashpalla or Daspalla. Other historians tell that king Sal Bhanj had only das (oriya for 10) Pallies (villages) so Daspalli got renamed as Daspalla. This incident took place in 1495. King Sal Bhanj ruled for 3 years only and
    then his son Naran Bhanj ascended the throne.</p>
  <p>But records found at Boudh state reveal that Daspalla was formed by Naran Bhanj in 1498 during the reign of Siddya Bhanj. However, it is a fact that Daspalla was formed during the last part of 15th century being separated from Baudh.</p>
  <p>The headquarters of Daspalla changed from Badmul to Gania, Gania to Madhyakhand, Madhyakhand to Puruna Daspalla. The ninth king of Daspalla Padmanav Bhanj, during hunting, saw a wonderful thing that a wild dove was hunting and defeating a
    Chhanchan (Bird of prey). So, he thought the place a heroic one and decided to change his capital to that place. At that time there was a Kandha chieftain named Kunj Malik. King Padmanav Bhanj defeated Kunj Malik and started his capital here but
    after the name of Kunja Malik the capital got named as Kunjabanagarh.</p>
  <p>Guri Charan Deo Bhanj was crowned ruler in 1803. He was succeeded by a line of titular Rajas.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1861 – 1873 Narsimha Bhanj</li>
    <li>1873 – 1896 Chaitan Deo Bhanj</li>
    <li>1896 – 1913 Narayan Deo Bhanj</li>
    <li>913 – 15 Aug 1947 Kishor Chandra Deo Bhanj (b. 1908)</li>
